### Current Projects: 

**Stuck in the Rondo:** a data visualisation periodical exploring some of football's best stories through data. I am currently working on building the webpages & on the graphs for the first issue, looking at the success of the Spanish national team from 2008-2012. For now, the WIP website is located here: https://oddball8.github.io/

**B.A.E. (Bayesian Arithmetic Engine):** A desktop GUI made using Shoes! to calculate Bayes Theorem. The user fills in some of the variables and the program fills in the gaps.

**SOL: a virtual pet that helps you:** 
**SOL-20**
**SOL-CHAT**
**SOL-TWTTR**
